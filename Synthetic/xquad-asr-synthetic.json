The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage. A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship's propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA with 60 Hertz power, 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems. In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction.

Common uses of oxygen includes the production cycle of steel, plastics and textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals, rocket propellant, in oxygen therapy and life support systems in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving."}, {"qas": [{"question": "what chemist managed to make enough liquid oxygen to use for study", "id": "571c9348dd7acb1400e4c114", "answers": [{"text": "James Dewar", "answer_start": 25}]}, {"question": "in what year did do or experiment on liquid oxygen", "id": "571c9348dd7acb1400e4c115", "answers": [{"text": "1891", "answer_start": 3}]}, {"question": "when was liquid oxygen developed for commercial use", "id": "571c9348dd7acb1400e4c116", "answers": [{"text": "1895", "answer_start": 185}]}, {"question": "What welding process was demonstrated in 1901", "id": "571c9348dd7acb1400e4c118", "answers": [{"text": "oxyacetylene welding", "answer_start": 430}]}], "context": "In 1891 Scottish chemist James Dewar was able to produce enough liquid oxygen to study.

According to the Treaty on European Union articles 9 and 10, the EU observes \"the principle of equality of its citizens\" and is meant to be founded on \"representative democracy\". In practice, equality and democracy are deficient because the elected representatives in the Parliament cannot initiate legislation against the Commission's wishes, citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in Parliament as citizens of the largest countries, and \"qualified majorities\" or consensus of the Council are required to legislate. The justification for this \"democratic deficit\" under the Treaties is usually thought to be that completion integration of the European economy and political institutions required the technical coordination of experts, while popular understanding of the EU developed and nationalist sentiments declined post-war. Over time, this has meant the Parliament gradually assumed more voice: from being an unelected assembly, to its first direct elections in 1979, to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process. Citizens' rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all European member states: under TEU article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the Commission with one million signatures. TFEU article 227 contains a further right for citizens to petition the Parliament on issues which affect them. Parliament elections, take place every five years, and votes for Members of the European Parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote. There are 750 MEPs and their numbers are \"degressively proportional\" according to member state size. This means - although the Council is meant to be the body representing member states - in the Parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger member states. MEPs divide, as they do in national Parliaments, along political party lines: the conservative European People's Party is currently the largest, and the Party of European Socialists leads the opposition. Parties do not receive public funds from the EU, as the Court of Justice held in Parti \u00e9cologiste \"Les Verts\" v Parliament that this was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states. The Parliament's powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an Ombudsman pending any court proceedings. It can require the Commission respond to questions and by a two-thirds majority can censure the whole Commission (as happened to the Santer Commission in 1999). In some cases, the Parliament has explicit consultation rights, which the Commission must genuinely follow. However its role participation in the legislative process still remains limited because no member can actually or pass legislation without the Commission and Council, meaning power (\"kratia\") is not in the hands of directly elected representatives of the people (\"demos\"): in the EU it is not yet true that \"the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few.\""}, {"qas": [{"question": "if there is a conflict between EU law and national law which La take precedence", "id": "57265e455951b619008f70bb", "answers": [{"text": "EU law", "answer_start": 399}]}, {"question": "what was the reason the Italian constitutional cord gave that resulted in Mr cost of losing his his claim against Dental", "id": "57265e455951b619008f70bc", "answers": [{"text": "because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim", "answer_start": 924}]}, {"question": "what were the years to regulations that conflicted with an Italian law originated in the simmenthal spa case", "id": "57265e455951b619008f70bd", "answers": [{"text": "1964 and 1968", "answer_start": 2214}]}, {"question": "which entities have had to develop principles dedicated to conflict resolution between laws of different systems", "id": "5726975c708984140094cb1f", "answers": [{"text": "the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts", "answer_start": 133}]}, {"question": "when did cost of Eno take place", "id": "5726975c708984140094cb20", "answers": [{"text": "1964", "answer_start": 446}]}, {"question": "Which cord argue that the Treaty of Rome did not prevent energy nationalism", "id": "5726975c708984140094cb21", "answers": [{"text": "the Court of Justice", "answer_start": 1043}]}], "context": "Since its founding, the EU has operated among an increasing plurality of national and globalising legal systems. This has meant both the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems. Within the EU itself, the Court of Justice's view is that if EU law conflicts with a provision of national law, then EU law has primacy. In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations. He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos, said member states \"albeit within limited spheres, have restricted their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves\" on the \"basis of reciprocity\". EU law would not \"be overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed... without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question.\" This meant any \"subsequent unilateral act\" of the member state inapplicable. Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, a company, Simmenthal SpA, claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968. In \"accordance with the principle of the precedence of Community law,\" said the Court of Justice, the \"directly applicable measures of the institutions\" (such as the Regulations in the case) \"render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law\". This was necessary to prevent a \"corresponding denial\" of Treaty \"obligations undertaken unconditionally and irrevocably by member states\", that could \"imperil the very foundations of the\" EU. But despite the views of the Court of Justice, the national courts of member states have not accepted the same analysis."}, {"qas": [{"question": "how many original treaties establishing the EU protected fundamental rights", "id": "5726a299dd62a815002e8b9e", "answers": [{"text": "None", "answer_start": 0}]}, {"question": "which entities were originally concerned with preventing violation of Human Rights", "id": "5726a299dd62a815002e8b9f", "answers": [{"text": "member states", "answer_start": 303}]}, {"question": "when was the European convention on human rights established", "id": "5726a299dd62a815002e8ba0", "answers": [{"text": "1950", "answer_start": 436}]}, {"question": "what other entity was established at the same time as the European convention on human rights", "id": "5726a299dd62a815002e8ba1", "answers": [{"text": "European Court of Human Rights.", "answer_start": 470}]}, {"question": "when did the European Council tasks an entity with drafting a European Charter of Human Rights", "id": "5726a299dd62a815002e8ba2", "answers": [{"text": "1999", "answer_start": 764}]}], "context": "None of the original treaties establishing the European Union mention protection for fundamental rights.

The European Court of Justice recognised fundamental rights as general principle of European Union law as the need to ensure that European Union measures are compatible with the human rights enshrined in member states' constitution became ever more apparent. In 1999 the European Council set up a body tasked with drafting a European Charter of Human Rights, which could form the constitutional basis for the European Union and as such tailored specifically to apply to the European Union and its institutions.

Ctenophores have been purported to be the sister lineage to the Bilateria, sister to the Cnidaria, sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria, and sister to all other animal phyla. A series of studies that looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways (e.g., homeoboxes, nuclear receptors, the Wnt signaling pathway, and sodium channels) showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios, that ctenophores are either sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla. Several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals. This position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types were either lost in major animal lineages (e.g., Porifera) or that they evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage. However, other researchers have argued that the placement of Ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes, and that Porifera (sponges) is the earliest-diverging animal phylum instead. Ctenophores and sponges are also the only known animal phyla that lack any true hox genes."}]}, {"title": "Fresno,_California", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "what is another name for the west side of Fresno", "id": "5725edfe38643c19005ace9f", "answers": [{"text": "Southwest Fresno", "answer_start": 46}]}, {"question": "in which direction does the west side of Fresno neighborhood lied to the 99 Freeway", "id": "5725edfe38643c19005acea0", "answers": [{"text": "southwest", "answer_start": 135}]}, {"question": "the west side of Fresno as the center of which ethnic community", "id": "5725edfe38643c19005acea1", "answers": [{"text": "African-American", "answer_start": 420}]}, {"question": "what are the two principal Asian American groups living in the Westside neighborhood of Fresno", "id": "5725edfe38643c19005acea2", "answers": [{"text": "Hmong or Laotian", "answer_start": 552}]}, {"question": "which neighborhood lies west of the 41 freeway", "id": "5725edfe38643c19005acea3", "answers": [{"text": "West Side", "answer_start": 5}]}], "context": "The \"West Side\" of Fresno, also often called \"Southwest Fresno\", is one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city.

Archaeologist Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of a large number of rats in the archaeological record of the medieval waterfront in London and that the plague spread too quickly to support the thesis that the Y. pestis was spread from fleas on rats; he argues that transmission must have been person to person. However, no single alternative solution has achieved widespread acceptance. Many scholars arguing for the Y. pestis as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases, including typhus, smallpox and respiratory infections. In addition to the bubonic infection, others point to additional septicemic (a type of \"blood poisoning\") and pneumonic (an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of the plague, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms.

Muhammad ibn Zakar\u012bya R\u0101zi (Rhazes) (865\u2013915), for instance, acted to promote the medical uses of chemical compounds. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis) (936\u20131013) pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation. His Liber servitoris is of particular interest, as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the `simples\u2019 from which were compounded the complex drugs then generally used. Sabur Ibn Sahl (d 869), was, however, the first physician to initiate pharmacopoedia, describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments. Al-Biruni (973\u20131050) wrote one of the most valuable Islamic works on pharmacology, entitled Kitab al-Saydalah (The Book of Drugs), in which he detailed the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist. Avicenna, too, described no less than 700 preparations, their properties, modes of action, and their indications. He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in The Canon of Medicine. Of great impact were also the works by al-Maridini of Baghdad and Cairo, and Ibn al-Wafid (1008\u20131074), both of which were printed in Latin more than fifty times, appearing as De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus by 'Mesue' the younger, and the Medicamentis simplicibus by 'Abenguefit'. Peter of Abano (1250\u20131316) translated and added a supplement to the work of al-Maridini under the title De Veneris. Al-Muwaffaq\u2019s contributions in the field are also pioneering. Living in the 10th century, he wrote The foundations of the true properties of Remedies, amongst others describing arsenious oxide, and being acquainted with silicic acid. He made clear distinction between sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, and drew attention to the poisonous nature of copper compounds, especially copper vitriol, and also lead compounds. He also describes the distillation of sea-water for drinking.[verification needed]"}, {"qas": [{"question": "what is the dispensary subject to in a majority of countries", "id": "5726e08e5951b619008f810f", "answers": [{"text": "pharmacy legislation", "answer_start": 48}]}, {"question": "what responsibilities were pharmacy technicians formerly limited too", "id": "5726e08e5951b619008f8110", "answers": [{"text": "within the dispensary compounding/dispensing medications", "answer_start": 224}]}, {"question": "what do pharmacy technicians depend on more and more", "id": "5726e08e5951b619008f8111", "answers": [{"text": "automation", "answer_start": 481}]}, {"question": "what are new responsibilities pharmacy technicians now deal with", "id": "5726e08e5951b619008f8112", "answers": [{"text": "patients' prescriptions and patient safety issues", "answer_start": 538}]}, {"question": "what does Pharmacy legislation mandate", "id": "5726e08e5951b619008f8113", "answers": [{"text": "storage conditions, compulsory texts, equipment, etc.", "answer_start": 92}]}], "context": "In most countries, the dispensary is subject to pharmacy legislation; with requirements for storage conditions, compulsory texts, equipment, etc., specified in legislation.

It is either Q or the finite field with p elements, whence the name. Often a second, additional meaning is intended by using the word prime, namely that any object can be, essentially uniquely, decomposed into its prime components. For example, in knot theory, a prime knot is a knot that is indecomposable in the sense that it cannot be written as the knot sum of two nontrivial knots. Any knot can be uniquely expressed as a connected sum of prime knots.

This theory, based on the everyday experience of how objects move, such as the constant application of a force needed to keep a cart moving, had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of projectiles, such as the flight of arrows. The place where the archer moves the projectile was at the start of the flight, and while the projectile sailed through the air, no discernible efficient cause acts on it.

For example, Isaac Newton unified the force responsible for objects falling at the surface of the Earth with the force responsible for the orbits of celestial mechanics in his universal theory of gravitation. Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic forces were unified through one consistent theory of electromagnetism. In the 20th century, the development of quantum mechanics led to a modern understanding that the first three fundamental forces (all except gravity) are manifestations of matter (fermions) interacting by exchanging virtual particles called gauge bosons. This standard model of particle physics posits a similarity between the forces and led scientists to predict the unification of the weak and electromagnetic forces in electroweak theory subsequently confirmed by observation. The complete formulation of the standard model predicts an as yet unobserved Higgs mechanism, but observations such as neutrino oscillations indicate that the standard model is incomplete. A Grand Unified Theory allowing for the combination of the electroweak interaction with the strong force is held out as a possibility with candidate theories such as supersymmetry proposed to accommodate some of the outstanding unsolved problems in physics. Physicists are still attempting to develop self-consistent unification models that would combine all four fundamental interactions into a theory of everything. Einstein tried and failed at this endeavor, but currently the most popular approach to answering this question is string theory.:212\u2013219"}, {"qas": [{"question": "what theory best explains gravity", "id": "57378b141c4567190057449f", "answers": [{"text": "general relativity", "answer_start": 24}]}, {"question": "what space-time path is seen as a curved line in space", "id": "57378b141c456719005744a0", "answers": [{"text": "ballistic trajectory", "answer_start": 716}]}, {"question": "what is the derivative of an object's change in momentum called", "id": "57378b141c456719005744a1", "answers": [{"text": "gravitational force", "answer_start": 1117}]}, {"question": "in what sense must you be observing the curvature of space-time", "id": "57378b141c456719005744a2", "answers": [{"text": "global", "answer_start": 498}]}], "context": "Since then, and so far, general relativity has been acknowledged as the theory that best explains gravity. In GR, gravitation is not viewed as a force, but rather, objects moving freely in gravitational fields travel under their own inertia in straight lines through curved space-time \u2013 defined as the shortest space-time path between two space-time events. From the perspective of the object, all motion occurs as if there were no gravitation whatsoever. It is only when observing the motion in a global sense that the curvature of space-time can be observed and the force is inferred from the object's curved path. Thus, the straight line path in space-time is seen as a curved line in space, and it is called the ballistic trajectory of the object. For example, a basketball thrown from the ground moves in a parabola, as it is in a uniform gravitational field. Its space-time trajectory (when the extra ct dimension is added) is almost a straight line, slightly curved (with the radius of curvature of the order of few light-years). The time derivative of the changing momentum of the object is what we label as \"gravitational force\"."}, {"qas": [{"question": "what is the time rate of change of electric charge", "id": "57378c9b1c456719005744a8", "answers": [{"text": "electric current", "answer_start": 36}]}, {"question": "what magnetic and electric force acts on a charge", "id": "57378c9b1c456719005744a9", "answers": [{"text": "unified electromagnetic force", "answer_start": 294}]}, {"question": "what is the long name that defines a charge moving through a magnetic field", "id": "57378c9b1c456719005744a7", "answers": [{"text": "Lorentz's Law", "answer_start": 139}]}, {"question": "what are the electrostatic and magnetic force are written as the sum of", "id": "57378c9b1c456719005744aa", "answers": [{"text": "electrostatic force", "answer_start": 389}]}], "context": "Through combining the definition of electric current as the time rate of change of electric charge, a rule of vector multiplication called Lorentz's Law describes the force on a charge moving in a magnetic field.
