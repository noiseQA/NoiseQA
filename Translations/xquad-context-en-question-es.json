Common uses of oxygen includes the production cycle of steel, plastics and textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals, rocket propellant, in oxygen therapy and life support systems in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving."}, {"qas": [{"title": "Oxygen", "question": "Which chemist managed to produce enough liquid oxygen to use in the study?", "answers": [{"text": "James Dewar", "answer_start": 25}], "original_question": "\u00bfQu\u00e9 qu\u00edmico logr\u00f3 producir suficiente ox\u00edgeno l\u00edquido para utilizarlo en el estudio?", "context": "In 1891 Scottish chemist James Dewar was able to produce enough liquid oxygen to study.

Citizens' rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all European member states: under TEU article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the Commission with one million signatures. TFEU article 227 contains a further right for citizens to petition the Parliament on issues which affect them. Parliament elections, take place every five years, and votes for Members of the European Parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote. There are 750 MEPs and their numbers are \"degressively proportional\" according to member state size. This means - although the Council is meant to be the body representing member states - in the Parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger member states. MEPs divide, as they do in national Parliaments, along political party lines: the conservative European People's Party is currently the largest, and the Party of European Socialists leads the opposition. Parties do not receive public funds from the EU, as the Court of Justice held in Parti \u00e9cologiste \"Les Verts\" v Parliament that this was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states. The Parliament's powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an Ombudsman pending any court proceedings. It can require the Commission respond to questions and by a two-thirds majority can censure the whole Commission (as happened to the Santer Commission in 1999). In some cases, the Parliament has explicit consultation rights, which the Commission must genuinely follow. However its role participation in the legislative process still remains limited because no member can actually or pass legislation without the Commission and Council, meaning power (\"kratia\") is not in the hands of directly elected representatives of the people (\"demos\"): in the EU it is not yet true that \"the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few.\""}, {"qas": [{"title": "European_Union_law", "question": "In case of conflict between EU law and national law, which law prevails?", "answers": [{"text": "EU law", "answer_start": 399}], "original_question": "En caso de conflicto entre la legislaci\u00f3n de la UE y la legislaci\u00f3n nacional, \u00bfqu\u00e9 legislaci\u00f3n prevalece?", "context": "Since its founding, the EU has operated among an increasing plurality of national and globalising legal systems.

In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations.

The principle becomes quite complex, however, given the uncertainties of fossilization, the localization of fossil types due to lateral changes in habitat (facies change in sedimentary strata), and that not all fossils may be found globally at the same time."}, {"qas": [{"title": "Geology", "question": "Who analyzes stratigraphic sections, such as drill cores?", "answers": [{"text": "stratigraphers", "answer_start": 19}], "original_question": "\u00bfQui\u00e9n analiza las secciones estratigr\u00e1ficas, como los n\u00facleos de perforaci\u00f3n?", "context": "In the laboratory, stratigraphers analyze samples of stratigraphic sections that can be returned from the field, such as those from drill cores.

Inflammation causes a great deal of oxidative stress and the presence of melatonin during sleep times could actively counteract free radical production during this time."}, {"qas": [{"title": "Immune_system", "question": "What molecules of the adaptive immune system exist only in maxillary vertebrates?", "answers": [{"text": "immunoglobulins and T cell receptors", "answer_start": 159}], "original_question": "\u00bfQu\u00e9 mol\u00e9culas del sistema inmunol\u00f3gico adaptativo solo existen en los vertebrados maxilares?", "context": "Evolution of the adaptive immune system occurred in an ancestor of the jawed vertebrates.

The Tran dynasty which ruled Annam (Dai Viet) crushed and defeated the Mongols at the Battle of B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng (1288). The Chinese region of Fujian was the original home of the Chinese Tran (Chen) clan before they migrated under Tr\u1ea7n Kinh (\u9673\u4eac, Ch\u00e9n J\u012bng) to Dai Viet and whose descendants established the Tr\u1ea7n dynasty which ruled Vietnam \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t, and certain members of the clan could still speak Chinese such as when a Yuan dynasty envoy had a meeting with the Chinese-speaking Tr\u1ea7n prince Tr\u1ea7n Qu\u1ed1c Tu\u1ea5n (later King Tr\u1ea7n H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o) in 1282. Professor Liam Kelley noted that people from Song dynasty China like Zhao Zhong and Xu Zongdao fled to Tran dynasty ruled Vietnam after the Mongol invasion of the Song and they helped the Tran fight against the Mongol invasion. The Tran dynasty originated from the Fujian region of China as did the Daoist cleric Xu Zongdao who recorded the Mongol invasion and referred to them as \"Northern bandits\". Annam, Burma, and Champa recognized Mongol hegemony and established tributary relations with the Yuan dynasty."}, {"qas": [{"title": "Yuan_dynasty", "question": "Who was the son of Ayurbarwada?", "answers": [{"text": "Gegeen Khan", "answer_start": 8}], "original_question": "\u00bfQui\u00e9n era el hijo de Ayurbarwada?", "context": "Emperor Gegeen Khan, Ayurbarwada's son and successor, ruled for only two years, from 1321 to 1323.

In the 20th century, the development of quantum mechanics led to a modern understanding that the first three fundamental forces (all except gravity) are manifestations of matter (fermions) interacting by exchanging virtual particles called gauge bosons. This standard model of particle physics posits a similarity between the forces and led scientists to predict the unification of the weak and electromagnetic forces in electroweak theory subsequently confirmed by observation. The complete formulation of the standard model predicts an as yet unobserved Higgs mechanism, but observations such as neutrino oscillations indicate that the standard model is incomplete. A Grand Unified Theory allowing for the combination of the electroweak interaction with the strong force is held out as a possibility with candidate theories such as supersymmetry proposed to accommodate some of the outstanding unsolved problems in physics. Physicists are still attempting to develop self-consistent unification models that would combine all four fundamental interactions into a theory of everything.
