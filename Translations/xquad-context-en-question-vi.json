The measurement is technically difficult owing to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the physical structure of vegetation; but it has been proposed as a possible method of monitoring the carbon cycle from satellites on a global scale."}, {"qas": [{"title": "Oxygen", "question": "What equipment is used to treat a variety of conditions such as carbon monoxide poisoning?", "answers": [{"text": "oxygen chambers", "answer_start": 49}], "original_question": "Thi\u1ebft b\u1ecb n\u00e0o \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c s\u1eed d\u1ee5ng \u0111\u1ec3 \u0111i\u1ec1u tr\u1ecb nhi\u1ec1u b\u1ec7nh tr\u1ea1ng kh\u00e1c nhau nh\u01b0 ng\u1ed9 \u0111\u1ed9c kh\u00ed c\u00e1c bon monoxit?", "context": "Hyperbaric (high-pressure) medicine uses special oxygen chambers to increase the partial pressure of O\n2 around the patient and, when needed, the medical staff.

This means - although the Council is meant to be the body representing member states - in the Parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger member states.

The Parliament's powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an Ombudsman pending any court proceedings. It can require the Commission respond to questions and by a two-thirds majority can censure the whole Commission (as happened to the Santer Commission in 1999). In some cases, the Parliament has explicit consultation rights, which the Commission must genuinely follow. However its role participation in the legislative process still remains limited because no member can actually or pass legislation without the Commission and Council, meaning power (\"kratia\") is not in the hands of directly elected representatives of the people (\"demos\"): in the EU it is not yet true that \"the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few.\"", "id": "5726938af1498d1400e8e44a"}], "context": "While the Commission has a monopoly on initiating legislation, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have powers of amendment and veto during the legislative process. According to the Treaty on European Union articles 9 and 10, the EU observes \"the principle of equality of its citizens\" and is meant to be founded on \"representative democracy\". In practice, equality and democracy are deficient because the elected representatives in the Parliament cannot initiate legislation against the Commission's wishes, citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in Parliament as citizens of the largest countries, and \"qualified majorities\" or consensus of the Council are required to legislate. The justification for this \"democratic deficit\" under the Treaties is usually thought to be that completion integration of the European economy and political institutions required the technical coordination of experts, while popular understanding of the EU developed and nationalist sentiments declined post-war. Over time, this has meant the Parliament gradually assumed more voice: from being an unelected assembly, to its first direct elections in 1979, to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process. Citizens' rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all European member states: under TEU article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the Commission with one million signatures.

These variations enable different species to build huge populations in the same area, because they specialize in different types of prey, which they capture by as wide a range of methods as spiders use."}, {"qas": [{"title": "Ctenophora", "question": "When did the Cretaceous Extinction event take place?", "answers": [{"text": "66 million years ago", "answer_start": 760}], "original_question": "S\u1ef1 ki\u1ec7n tuy\u1ec7t ch\u1ee7ng k\u1ef7 Ph\u1ea5n tr\u1eafng \u2013 Paleogen x\u1ea3y ra khi n\u00e0o?", "context": "Despite their soft, gelatinous bodies, fossils thought to represent ctenophores, apparently with no tentacles but many more comb-rows than modern forms, have been found in lagerst\u00e4tten as far back as the early Cambrian, about 515 million years ago.

Over the next several years in addition to host to host interactive connections the network was enhanced to support terminal to host connections, host to host batch connections (remote job submission, remote printing, batch file transfer), interactive file transfer, gateways to the Tymnet and Telenet public data networks, X.25 host attachments, gateways to X.25 data networks, Ethernet attached hosts, and eventually TCP/IP and additional public universities in Michigan join the network. All of this set the stage for Merit's role in the NSFNET project starting in the mid-1980s."}, {"qas": [{"title": "Packet_switching", "question": "\u00a0What is Internet2", "answers": [{"text": "a not-for-profit United States computer networking consortium led by members from the research and education communities, industry, and government", "answer_start": 13}], "original_question": " Internet2 l\u00e0 g\u00ec", "context": "Internet2 is a not-for-profit United States computer networking consortium led by members from the research and education communities, industry, and government.

Twigg suggested that the cause was a form of anthrax, and Norman Cantor (2001) thought it may have been a combination of anthrax and other pandemics. Scott and Duncan have argued that the pandemic was a form of infectious disease that characterise as hemorrhagic plague similar to Ebola. Archaeologist Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of a large number of rats in the archaeological record of the medieval waterfront in London and that the plague spread too quickly to support the thesis that the Y. pestis was spread from fleas on rats; he argues that transmission must have been person to person. However, no single alternative solution has achieved widespread acceptance. Many scholars arguing for the Y. pestis as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases, including typhus, smallpox and respiratory infections.

These tropical cyclones were the costliest indirect hits to Jacksonville. Hurricane Floyd in 1999 caused damage mainly to Jacksonville Beach. During Floyd, the Jacksonville Beach pier was severely damaged, and later demolished. The rebuilt pier was later damaged by Fay, but not destroyed. Tropical Storm Bonnie would cause minor damage in 2004, spawning a minor tornado in the process. On May 28, 2012, Jacksonville was hit by Tropical Storm Beryl, packing winds up to 70 miles per hour (113 km/h) which made landfall near Jacksonville Beach."}], "title": "Jacksonville,_Florida"}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"title": "Economic_inequality", "question": "What did Stiglitz say in 2009 about global inequality?", "answers": [{"text": "evidence", "answer_start": 36}], "original_question": "Stiglitz \u0111\u00e3 tr\u00ecnh b\u00e0y \u0111i\u1ec1u g\u00ec trong n\u0103m 2009 v\u1ec1 b\u1ea5t b\u00ecnh \u0111\u1eb3ng to\u00e0n c\u1ea7u?", "context": "Economist Joseph Stiglitz presented evidence in 2009 that both global inequality and inequality within countries prevent growth by limiting aggregate demand.

Some theories popular from the 1950s to 2011 incorrectly stated that inequality had a positive effect on economic development. Analyses based on comparing yearly equality figures to yearly growth rates were misleading because it takes several years for effects to manifest as changes to economic growth. IMF economists found a strong association between lower levels of inequality in developing countries and sustained periods of economic growth. Developing countries with high inequality have \"succeeded in initiating growth at high rates for a few years\" but \"longer growth spells are robustly associated with more equality in the income distribution.\""}, {"qas": [{"title": "Economic_inequality", "question": "What needs to be done to ensure that poorer social classes can participate in economic growth?", "answers": [{"text": "special efforts", "answer_start": 243}], "original_question": "C\u1ea7n ph\u1ea3i th\u1ef1c hi\u1ec7n \u0111i\u1ec1u g\u00ec \u0111\u1ec3 \u0111\u1ea3m b\u1ea3o c\u00e1c t\u1ea7ng l\u1edbp x\u00e3 h\u1ed9i ngh\u00e8o h\u01a1n c\u00f3 th\u1ec3 tham gia v\u00e0o t\u0103ng tr\u01b0\u1edfng kinh t\u1ebf?", "context": "While acknowledging the central role economic growth can potentially play in human development, poverty reduction and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, it is becoming widely understood amongst the development community that special efforts must be made to ensure poorer sections of society are able to participate in economic growth.

In 2011, the university completed the glass dome-shaped Joe and Rika Mansueto Library, which provides a grand reading room for the university library and prevents the need for an off-campus book depository."}, {"qas": [{"title": "University_of_Chicago", "question": "What is the name of the private boarding school for K-12 students run by the university?", "answers": [{"text": "University of Chicago Laboratory Schools", "answer_start": 138}], "original_question": "T\u00ean c\u1ee7a tr\u01b0\u1eddng t\u01b0 th\u1ee5c b\u00e1n tr\u00fa d\u00e0nh cho sinh vi\u00ean K-12 m\u00e0 tr\u01b0\u1eddng \u0111\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc \u0111i\u1ec1u h\u00e0nh l\u00e0 g\u00ec?", "context": "The university runs a number of academic institutions and programs apart from its undergraduate and postgraduate schools.

It is only when observing the motion in a global sense that the curvature of space-time can be observed and the force is inferred from the object's curved path. Thus, the straight line path in space-time is seen as a curved line in space, and it is called the ballistic trajectory of the object. For example, a basketball thrown from the ground moves in a parabola, as it is in a uniform gravitational field. Its space-time trajectory (when the extra ct dimension is added) is almost a straight line, slightly curved (with the radius of curvature of the order of few light-years).
