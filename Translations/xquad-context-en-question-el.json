According to the Treaty on European Union articles 9 and 10, the EU observes \"the principle of equality of its citizens\" and is meant to be founded on \"representative democracy\". In practice, equality and democracy are deficient because the elected representatives in the Parliament cannot initiate legislation against the Commission's wishes, citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in Parliament as citizens of the largest countries, and \"qualified majorities\" or consensus of the Council are required to legislate. The justification for this \"democratic deficit\" under the Treaties is usually thought to be that completion integration of the European economy and political institutions required the technical coordination of experts, while popular understanding of the EU developed and nationalist sentiments declined post-war. Over time, this has meant the Parliament gradually assumed more voice: from being an unelected assembly, to its first direct elections in 1979, to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process. Citizens' rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all European member states: under TEU article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the Commission with one million signatures. TFEU article 227 contains a further right for citizens to petition the Parliament on issues which affect them. Parliament elections, take place every five years, and votes for Members of the European Parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote. There are 750 MEPs and their numbers are \"degressively proportional\" according to member state size. This means - although the Council is meant to be the body representing member states - in the Parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger member states. MEPs divide, as they do in national Parliaments, along political party lines: the conservative European People's Party is currently the largest, and the Party of European Socialists leads the opposition. Parties do not receive public funds from the EU, as the Court of Justice held in Parti \u00e9cologiste \"Les Verts\" v Parliament that this was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states. The Parliament's powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an Ombudsman pending any court proceedings. It can require the Commission respond to questions and by a two-thirds majority can censure the whole Commission (as happened to the Santer Commission in 1999). In some cases, the Parliament has explicit consultation rights, which the Commission must genuinely follow. However its role participation in the legislative process still remains limited because no member can actually or pass legislation without the Commission and Council, meaning power (\"kratia\") is not in the hands of directly elected representatives of the people (\"demos\"): in the EU it is not yet true that \"the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few.\""}, {"qas": [{"title": "European_Union_law", "question": "If there is a conflict between EU law and national law, which law prevails?", "answers": [{"text": "EU law", "answer_start": 399}], "original_question": "\u0395\u03ac\u03bd \u03c5\u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c3\u03cd\u03b3\u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b7 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03be\u03cd \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0395\u0395 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b5\u03b8\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5, \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf \u03b4\u03af\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf \u03c5\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c7\u03cd\u03b5\u03b9;", "context": "Since its founding, the EU has operated among an increasing plurality of national and globalising legal systems.

The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos, said member states \"albeit within limited spheres, have restricted their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves\" on the \"basis of reciprocity\". EU law would not \"be overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed... without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question.\" This meant any \"subsequent unilateral act\" of the member state inapplicable. Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, a company, Simmenthal SpA, claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968. In \"accordance with the principle of the precedence of Community law,\" said the Court of Justice, the \"directly applicable measures of the institutions\" (such as the Regulations in the case) \"render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law\". This was necessary to prevent a \"corresponding denial\" of Treaty \"obligations undertaken unconditionally and irrevocably by member states\", that could \"imperil the very foundations of the\" EU. But despite the views of the Court of Justice, the national courts of member states have not accepted the same analysis."}, {"qas": [{"title": "European_Union_law", "question": "How many initial conditions in the establishment of the EU protect fundamental rights?", "answers": [{"text": "None", "answer_start": 0}], "original_question": "\u03a0\u03cc\u03c3\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b8\u03ae\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03af\u03b4\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0395\u0395 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03cd\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03c4\u03b1 \u03b8\u03b5\u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03ce\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1;", "context": "None of the original treaties establishing the European Union mention protection for fundamental rights.

Muhammad ibn Zakar\u012bya R\u0101zi (Rhazes) (865\u2013915), for instance, acted to promote the medical uses of chemical compounds. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis) (936\u20131013) pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation. His Liber servitoris is of particular interest, as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the `simples\u2019 from which were compounded the complex drugs then generally used. Sabur Ibn Sahl (d 869), was, however, the first physician to initiate pharmacopoedia, describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments. Al-Biruni (973\u20131050) wrote one of the most valuable Islamic works on pharmacology, entitled Kitab al-Saydalah (The Book of Drugs), in which he detailed the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist.

These molecules are believed to bind pathogenic antigens in a similar way to antibodies, and with the same degree of specificity."}, {"qas": [{"title": "Immune_system", "question": "What is the procedure by which the adaptive immune system is avoided by changing non-basic sites?", "answers": [{"text": "antigenic variation", "answer_start": 263}], "original_question": "\u03a0\u03ce\u03c2 \u03bb\u03ad\u03b3\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b7 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03c3\u03cd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03c6\u03b5\u03cd\u03b3\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03bc\u03b7 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03cc\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd;", "context": "The mechanisms used to evade the adaptive immune system are more complicated.

The discourse of Orientalism therefore served as an ideological justification of early Western imperialism, as it formed a body of knowledge and ideas that rationalized social, cultural, political, and economic control of other territories."}, {"qas": [{"title": "Imperialism", "question": "When imperialism affects the social rules of a state, what is it called?", "answers": [{"text": "Cultural imperialism", "answer_start": 0}], "original_question": "\u038c\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd \u03bf \u03b9\u03bc\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \u03b5\u03c0\u03b7\u03c1\u03b5\u03ac\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 \u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2, \u03c0\u03ce\u03c2 \u03bb\u03ad\u03b3\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9;", "context": "Cultural imperialism is when a country's influence is felt in social and cultural circles, i.e. its soft power, such that it changes the moral, cultural and societal worldview of another.

The place where the archer moves the projectile was at the start of the flight, and while the projectile sailed through the air, no discernible efficient cause acts on it.
