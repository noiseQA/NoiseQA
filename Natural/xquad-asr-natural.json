Over time, this has meant the Parliament gradually assumed more voice: from being an unelected assembly, to its first direct elections in 1979, to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process. Citizens' rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all European member states: under TEU article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the Commission with one million signatures. TFEU article 227 contains a further right for citizens to petition the Parliament on issues which affect them. Parliament elections, take place every five years, and votes for Members of the European Parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote. There are 750 MEPs and their numbers are \"degressively proportional\" according to member state size. This means - although the Council is meant to be the body representing member states - in the Parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger member states. MEPs divide, as they do in national Parliaments, along political party lines: the conservative European People's Party is currently the largest, and the Party of European Socialists leads the opposition. Parties do not receive public funds from the EU, as the Court of Justice held in Parti \u00e9cologiste \"Les Verts\" v Parliament that this was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states. The Parliament's powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an Ombudsman pending any court proceedings. It can require the Commission respond to questions and by a two-thirds majority can censure the whole Commission (as happened to the Santer Commission in 1999). In some cases, the Parliament has explicit consultation rights, which the Commission must genuinely follow. However its role participation in the legislative process still remains limited because no member can actually or pass legislation without the Commission and Council, meaning power (\"kratia\") is not in the hands of directly elected representatives of the people (\"demos\"): in the EU it is not yet true that \"the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few.\"", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 63, "text": "the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union"}], "id": "572651f9f1498d1400e8dbee", "question": "which two governing bodies have legislative veto power"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 474, "text": "cannot initiate legislation against the Commission's wishes"}], "id": "572651f9f1498d1400e8dbef", "question": "what kind of parliament do they cause of equality in democracy to be defeated"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1698, "text": "every five years"}], "id": "572651f9f1498d1400e8dbf0", "question": "open the parliament elections take place"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2740, "text": "a two-thirds majority"}], "id": "572651f9f1498d1400e8dbf1", "question": "how much of a voting majority must ever be to effectively send through the commission"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 3090, "text": "the Commission and Council"}], "id": "572651f9f1498d1400e8dbf2", "question": "what do buddies Master Parliament go through first to pass legislation"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 6, "text": "the Commission"}], "id": "5726938af1498d1400e8e446", "question": "which entity has a monopoly on initiating legislation"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 63, "text": "the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union"}], "id": "5726938af1498d1400e8e447", "question": "which entities are Falls of amendment invited in the legislative process"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1184, "text": "1979"}], "id": "5726938af1498d1400e8e448", "question": "when did the first direct elections take place"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1698, "text": "every five years"}], "id": "5726938af1498d1400e8e449", "question": "listen to Parliament elections take place"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2252, "text": "European People's Party"}], "id": "5726938af1498d1400e8e44a", "question": "which party is currently the largest amount of political party lines"}]}, {"context": "Since its founding, the EU has operated among an increasing plurality of national and globalising legal systems. This has meant both the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems. Within the EU itself, the Court of Justice's view is that if EU law conflicts with a provision of national law, then EU law has primacy. In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations. He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos, said member states \"albeit within limited spheres, have restricted their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves\" on the \"basis of reciprocity\". EU law would not \"be overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed... without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question.\" This meant any \"subsequent unilateral act\" of the member state inapplicable. Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, a company, Simmenthal SpA, claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968. In \"accordance with the principle of the precedence of Community law,\" said the Court of Justice, the \"directly applicable measures of the institutions\" (such as the Regulations in the case) \"render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law\". This was necessary to prevent a \"corresponding denial\" of Treaty \"obligations undertaken unconditionally and irrevocably by member states\", that could \"imperil the very foundations of the\" EU. But despite the views of the Court of Justice, the national courts of member states have not accepted the same analysis.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 399, "text": "EU law"}], "id": "57265e455951b619008f70bb", "question": "is there a contest between EU law and national law which law takes precedence"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 924, "text": "because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim"}], "id": "57265e455951b619008f70bc", "question": "what is a reason that you got in Confucian code gated is Ultimate Augusta losing his name against a man"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2214, "text": "1964 and 1968"}], "id": "57265e455951b619008f70bd", "question": "what would you use to regulate American pleated with an Italian law originated in the cement on 40"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 133, "text": "the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts"}], "id": "5726975c708984140094cb1f", "question": "which entities have had to develop principles dedicated to conflict resolution within laws of descent system"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 446, "text": "1964"}], "id": "5726975c708984140094cb20", "question": "when did coterminous take place"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1043, "text": "the Court of Justice"}], "id": "5726975c708984140094cb21", "question": "which Courthouse do the city of Rome did not prevent an empty nationalism"}]}, {"context": "None of the original treaties establishing the European Union mention protection for fundamental rights.

A series of studies that looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways (e.g., homeoboxes, nuclear receptors, the Wnt signaling pathway, and sodium channels) showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios, that ctenophores are either sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla. Several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals. This position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types were either lost in major animal lineages (e.g., Porifera) or that they evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage. However, other researchers have argued that the placement of Ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes, and that Porifera (sponges) is the earliest-diverging animal phylum instead.

However, no single alternative solution has achieved widespread acceptance.

In addition to the bubonic infection, others point to additional septicemic (a type of \"blood poisoning\") and pneumonic (an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of the plague, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms.

Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis) (936\u20131013) pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation. His Liber servitoris is of particular interest, as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the `simples\u2019 from which were compounded the complex drugs then generally used. Sabur Ibn Sahl (d 869), was, however, the first physician to initiate pharmacopoedia, describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments. Al-Biruni (973\u20131050) wrote one of the most valuable Islamic works on pharmacology, entitled Kitab al-Saydalah (The Book of Drugs), in which he detailed the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist. Avicenna, too, described no less than 700 preparations, their properties, modes of action, and their indications. He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in The Canon of Medicine. Of great impact were also the works by al-Maridini of Baghdad and Cairo, and Ibn al-Wafid (1008\u20131074), both of which were printed in Latin more than fifty times, appearing as De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus by 'Mesue' the younger, and the Medicamentis simplicibus by 'Abenguefit'.

In Aristotle's view, the terrestrial sphere contained four elements that come to rest at different \"natural places\" therein. Aristotle believed that motionless objects on Earth, those composed mostly of the elements earth and water, to be in their natural place on the ground and that they will stay that way if left alone. He distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their \"natural place\" (e.g., for heavy bodies to fall), which led to \"natural motion\", and unnatural or forced motion, which required continued application of a force. This theory, based on the everyday experience of how objects move, such as the constant application of a force needed to keep a cart moving, had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of projectiles, such as the flight of arrows.

For example, Isaac Newton unified the force responsible for objects falling at the surface of the Earth with the force responsible for the orbits of celestial mechanics in his universal theory of gravitation. Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic forces were unified through one consistent theory of electromagnetism. In the 20th century, the development of quantum mechanics led to a modern understanding that the first three fundamental forces (all except gravity) are manifestations of matter (fermions) interacting by exchanging virtual particles called gauge bosons. This standard model of particle physics posits a similarity between the forces and led scientists to predict the unification of the weak and electromagnetic forces in electroweak theory subsequently confirmed by observation. The complete formulation of the standard model predicts an as yet unobserved Higgs mechanism, but observations such as neutrino oscillations indicate that the standard model is incomplete. A Grand Unified Theory allowing for the combination of the electroweak interaction with the strong force is held out as a possibility with candidate theories such as supersymmetry proposed to accommodate some of the outstanding unsolved problems in physics. Physicists are still attempting to develop self-consistent unification models that would combine all four fundamental interactions into a theory of everything. Einstein tried and failed at this endeavor, but currently the most popular approach to answering this question is string theory.:212\u2013219", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 125, "text": "Isaac Newton"}], "id": "5737821cc3c5551400e51f19", "question": "who formed the universal theory of gravitation"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 479, "text": "20th"}], "id": "5737821cc3c5551400e51f1a", "question": "in what century was quantum mechanics made"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1457, "text": "unification"}], "id": "5737821cc3c5551400e51f1b", "question": "what kind of self-consistent models are physicists trying to make that would create a Theory of Everything"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1441, "text": "self-consistent unification"}], "id": "5737821cc3c5551400e51f1c", "question": "what type of physics model did Einstein fail to make"}]}, {"context": "Since then, and so far, general relativity has been acknowledged as the theory that best explains gravity. In GR, gravitation is not viewed as a force, but rather, objects moving freely in gravitational fields travel under their own inertia in straight lines through curved space-time \u2013 defined as the shortest space-time path between two space-time events. From the perspective of the object, all motion occurs as if there were no gravitation whatsoever. It is only when observing the motion in a global sense that the curvature of space-time can be observed and the force is inferred from the object's curved path. Thus, the straight line path in space-time is seen as a curved line in space, and it is called the ballistic trajectory of the object. For example, a basketball thrown from the ground moves in a parabola, as it is in a uniform gravitational field. Its space-time trajectory (when the extra ct dimension is added) is almost a straight line, slightly curved (with the radius of curvature of the order of few light-years).
